CQL, the Contextual Query Language, is a formal language for representing queries to information retrieval systems.
Its objective is to combine simplicity with expressiveness, to accommodate the range of complexity from
very simple queries to very complex. CQL queries are intended to be human readable and writable, intuitive,
and expressive.

This Java implementation can parse and generate CQL syntax, and translates CQL to Elasticsearch query language.
It also support extensive query options, filter queries and faceting, with breadcrumb state support
(checkboxes to add or remove facte values from a query).

More about CQL can be found under
